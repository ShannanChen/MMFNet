M2FNet: Multi-modality Multi-level Fusion Network for segmentation of acute and sub-acute ischemic stroke

We propose a novel Multi-modality Multi-level Fusion Network (M2FNet), an innovative method for segmenting ischemic stroke lesions in 3D multi-sequence MRI. 
M2FNet utilizes a sophisticated layered fusion approach, encompassing early, middle, and late stages, to skillfully integrate multiple imaging modalities, thereby enhancing lesion segmentation precision. The innovative design of this network primarily features MIE, MJL, CEFM, and CDFM.
Overall, M2FNet underscores the potential of multi-modal, multi-level fusion approaches in medical imaging for ischemic stroke lesion segmentation, offering a more precise and efficient tool for the diagnosis and treatment of ischemic stroke.

## Dataset 
We conducted empirical experiments on three publicly accessible datasets, ISLES'15, and ISLES'22, to evaluate the proposed network and modules' performance and utility.

## Code
The paper is being submitted and the full code will be published soon.
